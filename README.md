# I'm learning Python
Small projects that I created while learning Python.  This is probably uninteresting to anyone but me.

Here are some lists of possible programs to write, when learning a language.

* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
* draw things with [turtle](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~hyde/Python3/TurtleDirections.html)
* [CSE231 @ MSU.edu](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/PracticeOfComputingUsingPython/index.php)
* [MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/assignments/)
